# This file describes a number of hostname-to-address
# mappings for the TCP/IP subsystem.  It is mostly
# used at boot time, when no name servers are running.
# On small systems, this file can be used instead of a
# "named" name server.  Just add the names, addresses
# and any aliases to this file...
